# Aeon-data-science-project

The goal of this project is to distinguish receipts from a particular STORE NAME vs others with 55%+ accuracy.  
Example: “Is this receipt a “Walmart” receipt – Yes/No?” 

Train samples are about 4500 and test samples are about 1500.

Feedback from AEON that my model obtained 98% accuracy on test data while the second place has 92% and the third has 89%.
